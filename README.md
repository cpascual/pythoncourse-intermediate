# Pre-course checklist

**IMPORTANT**: Make sure to follow this checklist **before** starting the course:

- install the needed software (python2.7, PyQt4, scipy, pyqtgraph and an IDE) 
  **on your PC** (i.e. do not assume you can connect to Control Room or BL machines 
  during the course). It is highly recommended that you follow [these instructions](https://git.cells.es/cpascual/pythoncourse-intro/blob/master/pre-course.md)).
  *(Expected required time: 5'-30'  , Priority: high)*

- Have a quick look (for refreshing) at the material and docs from the 
  [intro course](https://git.cells.es/cpascual/pythoncourse-intro)
  *(Expected required time: 10'-30' , Priority: medium)*
  
- Dedicate *at least* 1 hour to reading **and understanding** [this article on
  Python OOP](https://jeffknupp.com/blog/2014/06/18/improve-your-python-python-classes-and-object-oriented-programming/)
  (note: you can stop when you get to "Abstract Classes"). 
  *(Expected required time: 60'-180' Priority: very high)*
  
- Install git on your machine and clone this repo. If you still haven't heard 
  about git, please follow the Git beginners tutorial from: 
  http://backlogtool.com/git-guide/en/ (you will not regret learning git).
  **All course-related communication (passing exercises, etc will be done via 
  git)**
  *(Expected required time: 20'-60' Priority: high)*

- If you intend doing serious python programming, I recommend installing and 
  using [PyCharm Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm)
  *(Expected required time: 30'-60' Priority: optional)*

- Try to install [pyqtgraph])(http://www.pyqtgraph.org/)
  *(Expected required time: 5'-10' Priority: low)*

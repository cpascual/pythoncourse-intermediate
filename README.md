# Pre-course checklist

**IMPORTANT**: Make sure to follow this checklist **before** starting the course:

- make sure that python 2.7, ipython, PyQt4, matplotlib, scipy and spyder are 
  installed in **your PC** (e.g. do not expect to connect to Control Room 
  machines during the course). If you use windows, just install 
  [PythonXY](http://python-xy.github.io). Try at least to launch spyder once. 
  If you need assistance, please contact Systems. 
  *(Expected required time: 5'-60'  , Priority: high)*
  
- Have a quick look (for refreshing) at the material and docs from the 
  [intro course](https://git.cells.es/cpascual/pythoncourse-intro)
  *(Expected required time: 10'-30' , Priority: medium)*
  
- Dedicate *at least* 1 hour to reading **and understanding** [this article on
  Python OOP](https://jeffknupp.com/blog/2014/06/18/improve-your-python-python-classes-and-object-oriented-programming/)
  (note: you can stop when you get to "Abstract Classes". 
  *(Expected required time: 60'-180' Priority: very high)*
  
- Install git on your machine and clone this repo. If you still haven't heard 
  about git, please follow the Git beginners tutorial from: 
  http://backlogtool.com/git-guide/en/ (you will not regret learning git).
  **All course-related communication (passing exercises, etc will be done via 
  git)**
  *(Expected required time: 20'-60' Priority: high)*

- If you intend doing serious python programming, I recommend installing and 
  using [PyCharm Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm)
  *(Expected required time: 30'-60' Priority: optional)*

- Try to install [pyqtgraph])(http://www.pyqtgraph.org/)
  *(Expected required time: 5'-10' Priority: low)*

# Qt exercise 1: create a basic widget

Run `python exercises.cheat.qtexercise1` and try to reproduce it by programming
it yourself. Pay attention to the layouts and the signals.

Notes:
- The widgets are: a QLineEdit, a QPushButton and a QTextBrowser in a QWidget
- Hint: use [qtexample02.py](/docs/qtexample02.py) as a template


# Qt exercise 2: create a basic widget with Qt designer

Do the same as qtexercise01 but using the Qt Designer

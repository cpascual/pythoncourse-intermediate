"""
Implement a Staff class that acts as a group (a sequence) of Collaborators.
It should be possible to :

- add new collaborators with `staff.add_collaborator()`
- get a numpy array containing the salaries of all collaborators (`salaries`)
- provide the number of collaborators when used with `len(staff)`

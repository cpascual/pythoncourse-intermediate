Useful resources:

- [Basic OOP Tutorial]

Course summary:

Day 1:
- We looked at the [Basic OOP Tutorial] examplesto introduce basic concepts such as:
  - classes, objects, instances
  - initialization, `self`
  - static methods
- We wrote [class_examples/oop_inheritance.py]() to play with inheritance (and multiple inheritance)
  - inheritance

- We used [oop_dawn.py] to dive deeper all previous OOP concepts and to introduce setter/getters and properties.
We created [class_examples/oop_dawn2.py]() to understand the properties.

- I proposed exercise 1 of [exercises/oop_dawn_exercises.md](/exercises/oop_dawn_exercises.md)
